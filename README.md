 Karate is supported by Java 8-12, and you can use any of these Java versions (After the Karate 1.0 version it supports all the versions).
 I recommend you to use Java 8 since it is the most popular long-term supported Java version. Besides Java, you need to have either Maven, Gradle, IntelliJ, or Eclipse installed. 

In addition to the above IDEs or build tools, you can use the Visual Studio Code with the extension of karate, and you can develop your scripts in Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code also provides the debug features, which is very useful.
